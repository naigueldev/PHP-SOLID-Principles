## Single-responsibility Principle - SRP
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

## Open-closed Principle - OCP
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov substitution principle - LCP
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

## Interface segregation principle - ISP
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion principle - DIP
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
